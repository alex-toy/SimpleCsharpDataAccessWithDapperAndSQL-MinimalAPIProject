# Simple Csharp Data Access With Dapper And SQL - Minimal API Project

Minimal APIs are now the default in .NET 6. In this project, we will cover setting up a SQL database and configuring Dapper for easy data access. We will set up a simple but full CRUD data layer so that when we build our minimal API, we can concentrate on the API itself and not the setup.
